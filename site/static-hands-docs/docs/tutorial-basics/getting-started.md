# Getting Started

## Basic Features

The Strength of these key bindings is in the shortcuts.

For example the shortcut Ctrl+Left Arrow is a great shortcut, but in reality that forces us, developers, to move our hands to the sides. We can now use CapsLock+f+j and get the same results without any effort! It'll take some time to fully get used to it, but it will pay off.

Let's dive in!
