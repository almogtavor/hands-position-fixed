:::

- **Option two**: Download [**AutoHotKey**](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

      $ git clone https://github.com/almogtavor/static-hands.git

  go to static-hands --> Windows --> run.ahk with AutoHotkey.

  To put ahk into effect automatically every time PC start:

  - Select run.ahk, and press Ctrl+C.
  - Press Win+R to open the Run dialog, then enter shell:startup and click OK or Enter.

    This will open the Startup folder for the current user.
    To instead open the folder for all users, enter shell: common startup (however, in that case, you must be an administrator to proceed).

  - Right-click inside the window, and click "Paste Shortcut". The shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.
